# McJoe-the-Zombie-Slayer
Game

When making the game we realized that our computers run at different speeds.
So if it is running to slow on your computer change frameRate() **line 42 in the world file** to a higher number.
If it is running to fast lower the frameRate() to run smoothly on your computer when running.

Our RangedWeapon class is not finished since it was one of our drafted items on our documentation.
Didn't have a chance to finish it.
